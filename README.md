Simple Sales Data Visualization

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data to gain insights into product performance and revenue trends over time. By using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we can efficiently process and visualize the data to make informed business decisions.

Step 1: Import Libraries
We import the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization

Step 2: Load the Dataset
We read the sales data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame

Step 3: Display the First Few Rows
We print the first five rows of the dataset to get an initial look at the data

Step 4: Convert the 'Date' Column to Datetime Format
We convert the 'Date' column to a datetime object to facilitate date-related operations

Step 5: Plot the Total Revenue per Product
We create a bar plot to visualize the total revenue generated by each product

Step 6: Plot the Total Units Sold per Product
We create a bar plot to visualize the total units sold for each product

Step 7: Plot the Daily Revenue Over Time
We create a line plot to visualize the daily revenue over time
